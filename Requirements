Gojek started as a call center that receives bookings from calls. Once the executive
receives a call, he will need to dispatch a driver to the booking. If all drivers are occupied,
the executive needs to tell the customer. A new driver needs to be registered to the
system before he is available on the system. I want to create an automated booking
management system that allows the executive to dispatch drivers without human
intervention with the following features.

1. When a booking request comes in, I want to have a driver assigned to the booking
given a drive is available and return a booking_id in the response.
2. Distance information is needed on the booking creation.
3. A driver can only take a single booking at a time.
4. Once the driver completes the booking, they will notify the executive to make the
driver available in the pool.
5. The driver assignment is randomized.
